Problem Description
Create a design for a laser control system which drives a laser with a simple sine wave.
This system has the following requirements:
1. a waveform is transmitted through an external DAC
    1. The waveform is 1K samples at 1MSPS
    2. the start of this waveform should be synchronized to an external hardware trigger
2. A 1MHz ADC acquires data periodically to be used to update the transmitted waveform
    1. This acquisition should be synchronized (perhaps with some delay) with the
        transmitted waveform
3. Process the ADC data to validate the transmitted waveform
    1. calculate amplitude, mean, and frequency of the waveform
    2. output boolean signal if the waveform is within spec
4. Calculate and apply new waveforms based on given parameters
    1. input will be amplitude and frequency of the waveform,
    2. a new waveform should be a sin wave at the specified frequency and amplitude.
5. An asynchronous interface to a controlling microcontroller
    1. This exposes the following functionality
        1. waveform parameters
            1. target amplitude,
            2. target frequency
            3. acceptable deviation tolerance
        2. Initial / default waveform
            1. amplitude,
            2. frequency
            3. acceptable deviation tolerance
        3. start & stop commands

Design
1) Applicaiton will initialize control broadcast channel(tokio channel), reciever of this channel will be with both DAC and ADC interface
2) Application will initialize DAC config data channel to initialize with default DAC sample array
3) Application will support trigger over control channel  and also start/stop, amplitude and frequency change over control channel
4) Application will create DAC data channel that drives laser and provides input to ADC, this will be broadcast channel as well.
